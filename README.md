# Web-dev-exam-1
Web application for Web Development class (Fall 2018), first exam. It is a simple visualization of a vega-embed spec with custom data passed by csv. It also allows people to share their visualizations with custom data, and rate other visualizations. These are some of the main features:

- CSV parsing to use in vega-embed data
- Mostly responsive vega visualization (does not use fixed width)
- Restore spec button. Returns the spec to the default spec if no visualization has been chosen to edit or returns to the last selected edited visualization
- Visualization uploads include name
- Real time error reporting when parsing spec 

It is made with React for the frontend and Express.js with MongoDB for the backend. The React project is located in the `./frontend` folder. The final app has been deployed to heroku: http://stark-sea-16874.herokuapp.com/ for public usage.

## How to run it
To run this project, you need to have npm or yarn installed. In this case, we will detail instructions for npm:


 - Clone the project from the github repository:  
 `git clone https://github.com/Sxubas/Web-dev-exam1.git`  
 `cd duozi-web`  
 
 - Install backend project dependencies and run:  
 `npm install`  
 `node index.js`  
 
 - Install frontend project dependencies and run:  
 `cd ./frontend`  
 `npm install`  
 `npm start`  

Afterwards, both projects will be running. Backend API calls are bibnded to `localhost:8080` and frontend development server is binded to `localhost:3000`. Requesting `localhost:3000` through browser will run the app as it is on heroku (It proxies it's requests to `localhost:8080`).
